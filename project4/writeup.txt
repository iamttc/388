T1

Find address of input and then find difference with EBP.
Fill those bytes + 8 with padding, and then the next 8 need to be 
the new return address

T2
b vulnerable
x/32wx &buf
b on line after call
x/32wx &buf to see how it worked

calculate how many bytes for the shell (106), then use above^ to
see how many bytes before return addr (59 bytes), and then
add the return as &buf
