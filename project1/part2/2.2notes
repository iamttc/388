#Notes from discussion
#Two files same md5 hash, but print out different messages
#Md5 of both files same, but sha1 will be different




#So write a program that can do both things, and decide based on blob
#Blob will be different but look the same ;D
#Program vessel for doing good or bad, but is believed to always get good input. 
#However we can give it bad input that looks like good input (when hashed by MD5 and
#trick the user
