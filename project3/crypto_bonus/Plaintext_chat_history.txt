Alice:  Bob, I encrypted a secret message to you with our secret Pad and titled the message as EncryptedMsg1.

Bob:    Awesome! I used the same pad to reply, my encrypted message is in the file named EncryptedMsg2.

Alice:  Do you think the name One Time Pad means something?

Bob:    Nah, I think we're fine if we only used it to encrypt our two messages. No one else knows the pad!

Alice:  Perfect :)
