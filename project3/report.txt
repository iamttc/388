# Overview

The purpose of the pen test is to test the security of the SuperDuperSketchyCorp
network. We want to discover vulnerabilities that will help us better understand
how attackers would exploit it, and thus help SuperDuperSketchyCorp protect their
assets and data.

# Methodology

The first thing we did was look for a way to get onto the SuperDuperSketchyCorp Wifi
based on the flier that was found in the BBB lobby. Since we knew the password
had the format of 'EECS388-[0-9a-z][0-9a-z][0-9a-z]', we first wrote a small python
script to generate all 46656 possible passwords. Then we use aircrack-ng and the
BSSID of the SuperDuperSketchyCorp router along with this wordlist to and a pcap
file to crack the password. Using this password, we logged onto the SDSC wifi
network and used nmap to scan the entire local network for machines that had open 
ssh ports. Once we found one, we knew that we could log in using our uniqname if 
we could get our password.

Next we used the flier we found in the BBB to spoof an email to the helpdesk, making sure that
our umich email was in the Reply-To field, and thus the helpdesk emailed us our
passwords for the server. After logging onto the server, we used nmap to scan all the
ports that the server had open, and discoverd it also had port 80 open, implying
this server was hosting a website. This was confirmed by us reading the welcome.txt
file, which revealed to us that there was a backdoor we could use to ssh into the server using
superdupersketchycorp.com and the secret port 47923. 

We visited the website and clicked through all the great links that SDSC had for us, and found an 
admin page that we didn't have the credentials to log on to. Later however, when we used tcpdump to 
sniff the local network traffic, we found GET requests to /admin/ with an unencrypted admin username 
and password! We took this information and then logged onto the admin page, which revealed some secrets 
that were to be kept from employees, which we have included below along with all our other findings.

# Findings

During our pen test, we were able to discover the following information:

Hostnames: (Hostname port pairs)
*The server has the IP of 192.168.0.23 on the local network and has
 port 22 open for ssh and port 80 open for serving http traffic. This
 same server has a hostname of superdupersketchycorp.com (141.212.108.247),
 which we can access via ssh using any Wifi if we use port 47923, and 
 superdupersketchycorp.com is thus also the website that that server is
 hosting.


Encryption Keys:
*The Wifi password (technically key for encrypting the traffic over the network) is EECS388-1z4

Credentials:          Username      Password
*Admin credentials    mattley       388roxmysocks
*Our credentials      hirochri      Waqm9KJ
                      iamttc

Secrets:
*30% of the workforce will be layed off in March... If this news gets to the employees, SDSC's quarterly projections will drop.
*There is a remote office in the BBB now enabling remote work
*The password to the executive lounge has changed and is now: h4ppie8rthDay

Extra Credit:
*We uncovered Alice and Bob's encrypted messages to each other, and because they had both used the same one time pad, we 
 were able to use crib dragging to uncover their messages (shown below). We thus know that plays the saxophone and is
 possibly also Gandalf.. or just loves making long repetitive videos where he plays the sax to Gandalf's beautiful face!
 Unfortunately for Bob, the video that Alice promised not to share has somehow
 ended up on the SDSC website in the information link under the About Us tab.. oops!


Alice's message: Bob, thank you for trusting me with your secret. 
                 I'll keep your amazing sax skills private, I love 
                 you and promise not to share this video 
                 https://youtu.be/Sagg08DrO5U!

Bob's message: Alice, please don't tell anyone about our 
               meeting today. I don't want anyone to learn 
               my secret, it would ruin me. I love to play 
               the saxophone but I am so embarrassed!

# Remediation

We suggest SuperDuperSketchyCorp do the following in order to help improve the
security of their network:

*Immediately changing all of their user/admin passwords and additionally changing the
 wifi password to something much longer and more timeconsuming to crack.

*Fix helpdesk email service so that only employees can receive the helpdesk reply email
 and take additionally measures in securely getting locked out users new passwords (as
 mailing them their current password in plaintext is awful). In addition to that, perhaps
 avoid leaving semi-confidential documents in the BBB that allow random people to
 attempt to get onto your wifi and spoof emails to your helpdesk.

*Don't reuse one time pads for actually secret information, as
