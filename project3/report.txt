# Overview

The purpose of the pen test is to test the security of the SuperDuperSketchyCorp
network. We want to discover vulnerabilities that will help us better understand
how attackers would exploit it, and thus help SuperDuperSketchyCorp protect their
assets and data.

# Methodology

The first thing we did was look for a way to get onto the SuperDuperSketchyCorp Wifi
based on the flier that was found in the BBB lobby. Since we knew the password
had the format of 'EECS388-[0-9a-z][0-9a-z][0-9a-z]', we first wrote a small python
script to generate all 46656 possible passwords. Then we use aircrack-ng and the
BSSID of the SuperDuperSketchyCorp router along with this wordlist to and a pcap
file to crack the password. Using this password, we logged onto the SDSC wifi 
network and used nmap to scan the entire local network for machines that had open ssh ports. Once we found one,
we knew that we could log in using our uniqname if we could get our password.
Thus we used the flier we found in the BBB to spoof an email to the helpdesk, making sure that
our umich email was in the Reply-To field, and thus the helpdesk emailed us our
passwords for the server. After logging onto the server, we used nmap to scan all the
ports that the server had open, and discoverd it also had port 80 open, implying 
this server was hosting a website. This was confirmed by us reading the welcome.txt
file, which revealed to us that there was a backdoor we could use to ssh into the server using 
superdupersketchycorp.com and the secret port 47923.

spoof, login to server, nmap get http port and see in welcome.txt that there is a website
Sniff traffic, GET request to /admin/, find authorization, logon to admin part of website




# Findings

During our pen test, we were able to discover the following information:

Hostnames: (Hostname port pairs)
*The server has the IP of 192.168.0.23 on the local network and has 
 port 22 open for ssh and port 80 open for serving http traffic. This 
 same server has a hostname of superdupersketchycorp.com (141.212.108.247), 
 which we can access via ssh using any Wifi if we use port 47923.


Encryption Keys:
*The Wifi password (technically key for encrypting the traffic over the network) is EECS388-1z4

Credentials: (Username password pairs)
*There is an admin with the username: mattley and the password: 388roxmysocks

Secrets:
*30% of the workforce will be layed off in March... If this news gets to the employees, SDSC's quarterly projections will drop.
*There is a remote office in the BBB now enabling remote work
*The password to the executive lounge has changed and is now: h4ppie8rthDay

(Username and password pairs count as one finding, as do port and hostname pairs, and any collection of secrets found in one file or web page.)

# Remediation

We suggest SuperDuperSketchyCorp do the following in order to help improve the
security of their network:
