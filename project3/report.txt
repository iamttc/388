# Overview

The purpose of the pen test is to test the security of the SuperDuperSketchyCorp
network. We want to discover vulnerabilities that will help us better understand
how attackers would exploit it, and thus help SuperDuperSketchyCorp protect their
assets and data.

# Methodology

The first thing we did was look for a way to get onto the SuperDuperSketchyCorp Wifi
based on the flier that was found in the BBB lobby. Since we knew the password
had the format of 'EECS388-[0-9a-z][0-9a-z][0-9a-z]', we first wrote a small python
script to generate all 46656 possible passwords. Then we use aircrack-ng and the
BSSID of the SuperDuperSketchyCorp router along with this wordlist to and a pcap
file to crack the password. Using this password, we logged onto the SDSC wifi 
network and scanned the entire local network for machines that had open ssh ports. Once we found one,
we knew that we could log in using our uniqname if we could get ou

Wifi password: EECS388-1z4

Used 'ipconfig getifaddr en0' to get our local ip address on the network, then scanned
with 'nmap 192.168.0.166/24 -p 22' to discover that 192.168.0.23 had port 22 open for ssh.

After connecting to the server using the above ip and reading Welcome.txt, we found that we can ssh
into superdupersketchycorp.com using port 47923 while on MWireless.

Announcements

Layoffs are coming!

Just letting the exec's know, we'll be laying off 30% of the workforce come March. Be sure not to tell the employees until it's time. If this got out, our quarterly projections would drop.

Remote Office Work now possible

We're setting up a remote office in the Bob and Betty Beyster building at the University of Michigan.

The password to the executive lounge has changed.

Please use 'h4ppie8rthDay'.

# Findings

During our pen test, we were able to discover the following information:

Hostnames: (Hostname port pairs)


Encryption Keys:
@863 The password is technically the key for encrypting the traffic over the network so I'd say you're on to something ;) 

Credentials: (Username password pairs)

Secrets:
@864 Keep poking! Is there perhaps another purpose for the server? (hint check your port scan for interesting ports open on the SDSC machine)

Hostnames
(Username and password pairs count as one finding, as do port and hostname pairs, and any collection of secrets found in one file or web page.)

# Remediation

We suggest SuperDuperSketchyCorp do the following in order to help improve the
security of their network:
