# Overview

The purpose of the pen test is to test the security of the SuperDuperSketchyCorp
network. We want to discover vulnerabilities that will help us better understand
how attackers would exploit it, and thus help SuperDuperSketchyCorp protect their
assets and data.

# Methodology

The first thing we did was look for a way to get onto the SuperDuperSketchyCorp Wifi
based on the flier that was found in the BBB lobby. Since we knew the password
had the format of 'EECS388-[0-9a-z][0-9a-z][0-9a-z]', we first wrote a small python
script to generate all 46656 possible passwords. Then we use aircrack-ng and the
BSSID of the SuperDuperSketchyCorp router along with this wordlist to and a pcap
file to crack the password, which we found to be 'EECS388-1z4'.

Used 'ipconfig getifaddr en0' to get our local ip address on the network, then scanned
with 'nmap 192.168.0.166/24 -p 22' to discover that 192.168.0.23 had port 22 open for ssh.

After connecting to the network and reading Welcome.txt, we found that we can ssh
into superdupersketchycorp.com using port 47923 while on MWireless.
