Nice find team! We were already able to check out the other hosts 
and unfortunately did not find anything of interest, but it 
certainly looks like the suspect had access to the machine at 
141.212.111.42. However, it appears that the machine has changed 
IP addresses since the time of the murder.  The new address 
is 75.101.230.146. Please figure out how to log into this 
machine and investigate the situation. This raises additional 
questions for your analysis:

10. Who owns this machine, according to the files on it?

11. What does its purpose appear to be?
    (Hint: What network service is running?)

12. Was the suspect granted access to the machine, or was it
    compromised? If the suspect was granted access, when? If it was
    compromised, when and how was it compromised?

13. In either case, it appears as though the suspect has abused his
    access to the machine. How?

14. Can you remedy the abuse?  [Extra credit.]

Please get to the bottom of this. We're counting on you!
